# Synchronous-Machine-Model
This repo builds a dynamic model of a synchronous machine in MATLAB. 

The model is based on Chapter 7 of 'Power System Dynamics and Stability: With Synchrophasor Measurement and Power System Toolbox (2nd Edition)' by Peter W. Sauer (Author), M. A. Pai (Author), Joe H. Chow (Author)

## What is a Synchronous Machine?
- Synchronous Machines are at the heart of electric power grids around the world.
- These machines are generators that convert mechanical energy to electric energy (electricity).
- They interface power plants such as coal, nuclear and natural gas with the electricity grid. 
- The electric power grid is basically a collection of wires that connect these synchronous machines to anything that needs electricity.
- In order to understand how the electricity grid operates at a fundamental level, one must fully understand how to model a synchronous machine.

## Goals of this Repo: 
- This repo creates a synchronous machine model that is useful both in normal operation (steady state/small-signal model) and in transient conditions (such as when lightning strikes).

## Special Thanks:
- Thanks to Matthew Overlin of MIT who created his own synchronous machine dynamic model and inspired me to do the same.
